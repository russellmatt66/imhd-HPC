# Summary
High-performance scientific computing project to solve the Ideal MHD equations using a Lax-Wendroff scheme. 

This is a sequential code that achieves performance on par with the Cray-2 by accessing memory in a contiguous fashion. 

# C++
Development of the C++ version of the code is nearing completion. 

**Current Tasks:**
- Debug the boundary conditions, and tune the numerical diffusion coefficient.

## C
Development of the C version of the code has begun.

**Current Tasks:**
- Write the rank-3 tensor class.

## Fortran
