# Summary
High-performance scientific computing project to solve the Ideal MHD equations using a Lax-Wendroff scheme. 

This is a sequential code that achieves performance on par with the Cray-2 by accessing memory in a contiguous fashion. 

# C++
Development of the C++ version of the code is nearing completion. The current task is to debug the boundary conditions, and tune the numerical diffusion coefficient.

## C
Development of the C version of the code has not yet begun.

## Fortran
Development of the Fortran version of the code has not yet begun.

## Rust
Development of the Rust version of the code has not yet begun.
